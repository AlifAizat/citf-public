2) vax_state: Daily and cumulative vaccination at state level, as at 2359 of date.

**Static data**
_Unlike the datasets above, this data will (probably) be unchanged for the duration of the program, barring an update from the source, e.g. if DOSM makes an update to population estimates._

**More datasets will be shared in the coming days.**

We welcome pull requests to share scripts, processing algorithms, and other neat tricks with the community - these will be merged into `main/contrib/`. CITF does not maintain or guarantee the usage of any code or data at that path.
