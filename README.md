# CITF Public Dataset
Official data on the National Covid-â€‹19 Immunisation Programme (PICK) in Malaysia. Documentation contained within subfolders. Powered by MySejahtera.

**Vaccination**
1) `vax_malaysia.csv`: Daily and cumulative vaccination at country level, as at 2359 of date.
2) `vax_state.csv`: Daily and cumulative vaccination at state level, as at 2359 of date.

**Static data**

1) [[source: DOSM](http://pqi.stats.gov.my/searchBI.php?tahun=2020&kodData=2&kodJadual=1&kodCiri=1&kodNegeri=Semua)] `population.csv`: Total, adult (18+), and elderly (60+) population at state level.

_Unlike the datasets above, this data will (probably) be unchanged for the duration of the program, barring an update from the source, e.g. if DOSM makes an update to population estimates. We provide this data here not to supersede the source, but rather to synchronise computation of statistics down to the Nth decimal place, e.g. % of population that is vaccinated._


**More datasets will be shared in the coming days.**

We welcome pull requests to share scripts, processing algorithms, and other neat tricks with the community - these will be merged into `main/contrib/`. CITF does not maintain or guarantee the usage of any code or data at that path.
