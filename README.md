# Open data on Malaysia's National Covid-â€‹19 Immunisation Programme 
+ Documentation and data descriptions contained within subfolders. 
+ In the spirit of open sourcing, we welcome pull requests to share scripts, algorithms, and other neat tricks - these will be merged into `main/contrib/`. However, CITF does not guarantee the veracity or functionality of any code or data at that path.
+ To request more data, submit a pull request to [the public wishlist](https://github.com/CITF-Malaysia/citf-public/blob/main/WISHLIST.md).

**Vaccination**
1) `vax_malaysia.csv`: Daily and cumulative vaccination at country level, as at 2359 of date.
2) `vax_state.csv`: Daily and cumulative vaccination at state level, as at 2359 of date.

**Registration**
1) `vaxreg_malaysia.csv`: Cumulative registrations for vaccination at country level, as at 2359 of date.
2) `vaxreg_state.csv`: Cumulative registrations vaccination at state level, as at 2359 of date.

**Static data**

1) `population.csv`: Total, adult (18+), and elderly (60+) population at state level.

_Unlike the datasets above, this data will (probably) be unchanged for the duration of the program, barring an update from the source, e.g. if DOSM makes an update to population estimates. We provide this data here not to supersede the source, but rather to synchronise computation of statistics down to the Nth decimal place, e.g. % of population that is vaccinated._

**We will maintain and continually build upon this repo.**
